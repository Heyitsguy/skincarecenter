			<h2>Mission</h2>
			<hr class="style-four shorter-hr">
			<p>With over 5+ years of experience in the skincare industry, we here at C&F Skincare Center have seen a vast variety of different skin types and conditions. We get that everyone's a little different, thus we have many treatments to choose from. If you are overwhelmed and are not sure where to begin, please do not hesitate to contact us for questions. Our goal here is to find a solution that will work for you and leave you satisfied.</p>

			<h2>Why You Should Invest In Skin Care</h2>
			<hr class="style-four shorter-hr">
			<p>The best way for skin to look the best that it can is by following a proper routine of cleansing and moisturizing every day.  However, there are times when letting a professional do the work to either kickstart or enhance your routine is beneficial and can save more time and money. As we get older, a combination of environmental, stress and various other factors can lead to an unhealthy skin. Facials have been shown to reduce stress and treatments that involve removing old layers of dead skin can allow the body to use its own methods of repairing and producing new collagen for the skin.</p>
